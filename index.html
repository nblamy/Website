            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>My name is Nur Nabila binti Suharmy. I am 21 years old. I was born in 8 jun 2003 in Alor Setar, Kedah. Currently, I live in Simpang Empat, Kedah. When I work later, I aspire to share sustenance as much as possible to anyone. This is because, if we always use our sustenance for good things, then we will be blessed with sustenance. I also aspire to open my own business which is a food business such as a cake and pastry shop because I really like desserts. Besides that, I also aspire to help the wild cats that are in the market or anywhere else by providing a comfortable shelter for them. By doing things like this, I can remind myself to be grateful for everything that happens in our lives. Hopefully this spirit will continue to last in me so that with God's permission I can succeed in all the good things I want to do.</p>

        <p>Me as a person who likes to be at home, in free time or weekends, I will spend my time together with my cats. I can feel peace when playing with my cats as if all my problems are gone. I really enjoyed playing with them and I am very obsessed with them.Before this, I had 10 cats but some of them died and some of them just disappeared and did not come back until now. Now, there are only 3 cats left. I hope they will continue to stay healthy in my care. Next, sometimes I like to learn to cook a new recipe for my family. I am glad they always enjoy my cooking. Apart from that, I also like watching movies in many genres such as horror, comedy, action, adventure, cartoons and many more. I really enjoy it.</p>

            <p>I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in library management under the college of computing, informatics and mathematics at UiTM Kedah. I felt that this course was quite easy but when I started studying and it was quite difficult for me to adapt at the beginning but now I started to adapt little by little because there were too many challenges that I experienced mentally and physically. I will try to keep stronger to finish my studies to make my parents proud.</p>
